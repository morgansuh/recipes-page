  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>Snickerdoodle cookie recipe by Modern Honey with a few tweaks! This recipe creates soft and chewy cinnamon sugar
    cookies. </p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <h4>Cookie Batter:</h4>
    <li>1 cup Unsalted Butter (softened)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>
    <li>2 large Eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
    <li>2 3/4 cup Flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoon Cream of Tartar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    <h4>Cinnamon Sugar Mix:</h4>
    <li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons Cinnamon</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the
      bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer. </li>
    <li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined.
    </li>
    <li>In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon. </li>
    <li>If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll into small balls until round
      and
      smooth. Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the
      cookie balls are completely covered. <em>To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball
        before
        placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle. </em>
    </li>
    <li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes. Let cool for several minutes on baking
      sheet
      before removing from the pan. </li>
  </ol>
