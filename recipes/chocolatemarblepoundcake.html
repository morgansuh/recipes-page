    with a chocolate marble.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, softened, plus 3 tablespoons melted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch process</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>Confectioners' sugar, for dusting</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Lightly grease an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil or butter and line it with
      parchment paper. Grease the paper.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour with the baking powder and salt. In another medium bowl, combine the melted
      butter with the cocoa until smooth. </li>
    <li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined.
    </li>
    <li>In a food processor, combine the softened butter with the granulated sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla and process
      until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and pulse just until combined. Add the cream and process until smooth.
      Transfer 1 cup of the batter to the bowl with the cocoa and stir until smooth. </li>
    <li>Spoon half of the remaining batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Spread the chocolate batter in
      the pan, then cover with the remaining plain batter. Using a table knife, cut 5 swirls in the batter. Bake the
      pound cake for 25 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 325° and bake for 25 minutes more. Cover loosely with foil
      and bake for 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center
      comes out with moist crumbs attached. Let the pound cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then unmold and let cool
      completely on a wire rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>

  </ol>
